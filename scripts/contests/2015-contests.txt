Comments: The ACE's High Spring Opener will be a no frills, short form event. The contest is a one day, two flight, two category contest: Primary and Sportsman. We will fly the Power Primary Known and Power Sportsman Known 2015 program. All pilots are welcome but we will handicap pilots who normally fly Intermediate through Unlimited. We prefer to have pilots preregister in order to streamline operations. I'm adding a day at the request of a few people asking. We'll fly two flights and if the time weather permits three flights. We'll keep the airspace and box open for practice if we get done early. This is intended to be a fun event.
